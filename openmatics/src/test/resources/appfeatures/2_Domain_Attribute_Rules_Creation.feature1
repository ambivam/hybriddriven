Feature: 2.Importing Domain Objects for the solution

  Scenario Outline: Creating domain object for solution
    When user is on Domain object creation page and clicks on New Domain Object link "<domainObjName>"
    Then a menu slides with the properties section and user provides domain details to it and clicks on save button
      | domainObjName        | domainNERType | domainCardinality | domainSynonym |
      | automationtestdomain | PERSON        | test              | Test          |
    And verifies that domain object is created successfully
    When user clicks on attribute link and provides entity details to it and clicks on save button
      | domainObjName        | entitydataType | entityType    | entityNERType | entitySynonym | entityName        |
      | automationtestdomain | Entity         | Create Entity | PERSON        | Test          | BddPatientDetails |
      | automationtestdomain | Entity         | Create Entity | NORP          | Test          | BddVitals         |
    And verifies that entity attribute is created successfully
    When user clicks on attribute link and provides attribute details to it and clicks on save button
      | domainObjName        | attrEntityName | attrDataType | attrNERType | attrSynonym | entityName        |
      | automationtestdomain | mobile_number  | String       | PERSON      | Test        | BddPatientDetails |
    Then Apply a validation rule-test by clicking on the specific attribute "<domainObjName>" and "<entityType>" and "<attributename>"
      | RuleNameTxt                        | ValidationMsg                     | IfFunction    | IfCondition | ExpectedValue | TestValue  |
      | Mobnumvalidationwithchars          | Mobile Number should be 10 digits | Length(value) | Equals      |            10 | venugopalg |
      | Mobilenumbervalidationwithchars<10 | Mobile Number should be 10 digits | Length(value) | Equals      |            10 | venugopal  |
      | Mobilenumbervalidationwithdigits   | Mobile Number should be 10 digits | Length(value) | Equals      |            10 | 9581075263 |
    And verifies that attribute object is created successfully

    Examples: 
      | domainObjName        | entityType        | attributename |
      | automationtestdomain | BddPatientDetails | mobile_number |
