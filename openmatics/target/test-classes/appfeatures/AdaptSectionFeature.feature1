Feature: Create Models by importing different datasets

  Scenario Outline: Import Data set with different data format
    Given User must be in login page
    And Provide Solution Engineer "<username>" and "<password>"
    And Moves to Adapt Section for import dataset
    When User in Import Dataset window
    Then Enter "<datasetname>" and "<description>" and "<dataformat>" and "<datapath>"
    And Save Import dataset

    Examples: 
      | username   | password | datasetname  | description       | dataformat | datapath                                                  |
      | bddtest_se | pass     | reg csv data | reg csv data desc | csv        | /src/test/resources/data/adaptsection/Test/regression.csv |

  Scenario Outline: Create Model with Platform and model type regression
    Given User must be in login page
    And Provide Solution Engineer "<username>" and "<password>"
    And Moves to Adapt Section for import dataset
    Given User must be in adapt section page
    And Navigate to Create New Ensembels page
    When User in New Model Page
    Then Provide "<modelname>" and "<description>"
    And Select model format
    And Provide "<modeltype>" and "<dataset>" and "<targetcolumn>"
    And Save Model

    Examples: 
      | username   | password | modelname        | description           | modeltype  | dataset | targetcolumn |
      | bddtest_se | pass     | Model_regression | Model_regression_desc | regression | zipdata | label        |
